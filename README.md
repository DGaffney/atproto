## The AT Protocol SDK

> ⚠️ Under construction. The SDK was built from scratch for 40 hours. Somewhere I speedran. I have a list of things that will break backward computability. Until the 1.0.0 release, I am not going to care about it. 

Code snippet:
```python
from atproto import Client


def main():
    client = Client()
    profile = client.login('my-handle', 'my-password')
    print('Welcome,', profile.displayName)
    
    post_ref = client.send_post(text='Hello World from Python!')
    client.like(post_ref)

    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

<details>
  <summary>Code snippet of async version</summary>

```python
import asyncio

from atproto import AsyncClient


async def main():
    client = AsyncClient()
    profile = await client.login('my-handle', 'my-password')
    print('Welcome,', profile.displayName)
    
    post_ref = await client.send_post(text='Hello World from Python!')
    await client.like(post_ref)

    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())

```
</details>

### Introduction

This SDK attempts to implement everything that provides ATProto. Due to the unstable state of the protocol (it grows and changes fast) and a bit of outdated documentation, only the client side is supported yet. There is support for Lexicon Schemes and XRPC clients for now. All models, queries, and procedures are generated automatically. The main focus is on the lexicons of atproto.com and bsky.app, but it doesn't have a vendor lock on it. Feel free to use the code generator for your own lexicon schemes. SDK also provides utilities to work with CID, NSID, URI. The support of IPLD (dag-cbor) will be added in the near future.

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Access to Bsky if you don't have own server.

### Installing

#### From PyPI
``` bash
pip3 install -U atproto
```

#### From main branch of the repository
``` bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto.git
```

### Documentation

The documentation is live at [readthedocs.io](https://atproto.rtfd.io/).
